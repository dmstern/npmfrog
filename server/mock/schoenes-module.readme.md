```bash
node -v
```

```bash
npm -v
4.4.7
```

Although *npm* does comes with Node.js, itâ€™s a good idea to know how to update npm, since it needs to be updated more often than Node.js:
```bash
npm install npm -g
```

## <a name="intall"></a>Installation
Run this command for a complete installation of all `dependencies` :
```bash
npm i
```

Initialize workspace and `git-hooks`
```bash
npm run workspace
```
Git-Hooks are used for linter tasks.

### Update dependencies
Update or install new dependencies **node_modules** via *package.json* in the front-end folder locally via:
```bash
npm update
```

Start up the development and static browser-sync server by running:
```bash
npm start
```

The fractal server is configured for port **3003**, and the static browser-sync server to port **9000**.
After running `npm start` both servers are available on `localhost`: 
* **Fractal**: [http://localhost:3003/](http://localhost:3003/)
* **Browser-Sync**: [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)

Build a static prototype by running:
```bash
npm run staticbuild
```

## <a name="taskrunner"></a>Taskrunner
You can use `npm` to run `grunt` tasks:
```bash
npm run grunt -- [taskname]
```

You can install **Grunt** globally via Bash / cmd:
```bash
npm i -g grunt-cli
```

To see all available tasks run the default `grunt` task:
```bash
npm run grunt

Done.
```

**For example**: running full build of the prototype:
```bash
npm run grunt -- fullbuild
```

## <a name="pm2"></a> Process Manager pm2

All `pm2` tasks can be ran with npm:
```bash
npm run pm2 -- [command]
```

Show all running processes (server):
```bash
npm run pm2 -- l
```

Start or restart default fractal server:
```bash
npm run pm2 -- start BBK
```

Show server logs:
```bash
npm run pm2 -- logs BBK
```
This is a following command. To stop following logs use `ctrl + c` twice.

Show monitoring tool:
```bash
npm run pm2 -- monit
```

All logs can be found here in the `%basedir%/logs` .
